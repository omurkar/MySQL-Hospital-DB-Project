# MySQL-Hospital-DB-Project
I've developed a MySQL hospital database project with 6 tables: hospital, patient_table, doctor_table, nurse, medical_table, and billing_table. Each table employs BED_NO as a foreign key, enabling seamless integration of patient, medical, and operational data across the hospital's infrastructure.
