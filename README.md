# MySQL-Hospital-DB-Project

I have developed a MySQL project focused on a hospital database. In this database, I have crafted six tables:



1.hospital: Contains details about hospital owners, including names, addresses, and contact numbers.

2.patient_table: Stores comprehensive patient information such as ID, name, relatives, contact details, medical history, and assigned BED_NO.

3.doctor_table: Manages records of doctors, including their specialties, contact info, and assigned BED_NO.

4.nurse: Holds data on nurses, including their roles, contact details, and assigned BED_NO.

5.medical_table: Stores medical data like medications and treatments linked to patients.

6.billing_table: Manages billing information for medical services provided.

Each table is interconnected using BED_NO as a foreign key, ensuring seamless data retrieval and management across different facets of hospital operations.
